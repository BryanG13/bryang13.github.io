The [ELAVIO 2022](https://sites.google.com/view/elavio2022/home) summer school for young OR researchers. I also gave a presentation on a feeder service with maximum headway constraints at mandatory stops.

For this school I obtained a [scholarship from EURO](https://www.euro-online.org/web/pages/526/last-activitity-reports) and wrote [report](https://www.euro-online.org/media_site/reports/ELAVIO_22_Galarza%20_Montenegro.pdf) on my experience.
