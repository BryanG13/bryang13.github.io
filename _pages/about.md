Hi, I'm **Bryan David Galarza Montenegro**. I’m an Operations Research Expert with a strong interest in designing algorithms that improve decision-making in real-world systems. My career has been shaped by a fascination for complex optimization challenges, especially those that impact transportation, logistics, and healthcare.  

I am currently a **postdoctoral researcher at the University of Antwerp**, where I work on the [**STRAUSS**](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/ant-or/research-projects/project-strauss/) **project**, which focuses on sustainable urban logistics and the development of innovative solutions to reduce the environmental impact of city freight flows. Alongside this, I have also served as the **Lead Operations Research Expert** at **Triptomatic**, contributing to a **VLAIO-funded development project**: [*AI-powered Dispatching*](https://triptomatic.com/en-be/nemt#dispatching). In this role, I lead research, development and implementation on combinatorial optimization methods to make on-demand healthcare transportation more intelligent, efficient, and scalable.  

I hold a PhD in *Operations Research* from the University of Antwerp and a Master’s degree in *Engineering Science: Operations Research and Industrial Engineering* from Ghent University. Over the years, I have published several research papers on optimization in intelligent transportation systems and collaborated closely with both academia and industry to bridge the gap between theory and application.  

My research interests lie in urban logistics, non-emergency medical transportation, and public transport. I am particularly drawn to metaheuristics, exact methods, and data-driven solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy photography, traveling, and discovering hidden places away from busy cities. Exploring nature and small towns helps me recharge and often gives me new perspectives on the problems I tackle in my professional life.
